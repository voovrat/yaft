YAFT stays for Yet Another Fourier Transform

This is a fourier transform library, which uses the Cooley-Turkey and Rader algorithms.
The files are generated with a hard-coded constants for all possible values up to some given constant (e.g. 2048).
It uses the prime_numbers.h from voovrat_utils (see https://github.com/voovrat/voovrat-utils ).
